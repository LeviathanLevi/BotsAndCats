# BotsAndCats
This website was built off of an older one I had made and was just meant to be practice using HTML/CSS and some javascript.
The website is designed to explain five basic bot trading strategies, Mean Reversion, momentum trading, arbitrage trading, naive bayes, and natural language processing. Plus it has cats and some other random stuff.
